[00:21.70]Kinda love your sense of time
[00:23.57]Cos the days no matter no more
[00:26.12]Or the feelings that you hide
[00:28.40]Gonna tear you up inside
[00:32.10]You know she hopes you tried
[00:35.08]
[00:36.67]Follows you around all day
[00:38.39]And you wake up soaking wet
[00:40.85]Cos between this world and eternity
[00:43.66]There is a face you hope to see
[00:46.30]
[00:49.58]You know where you sent her
[00:52.02]You should know where you are
[00:54.52]You're trying to ease off
[00:56.93]But you know you won't get far
[00:59.71]And now she's up there
[01:02.15]Sings like an angel
[01:04.50]But you can't hear those words
[01:09.69]And now she'd up there
[01:12.24]Sings like an angel
[01:16.61]Unforgivable sinner
[01:19.14]
[01:24.03]You've been walking around in tears
[01:25.78]No answers are there to get
[01:28.53]You won't ever be the same
[01:30.70]Someone cries and you're to blame
[01:31.74]
[01:33.52]Struggling with a fight inside
[01:36.06]Sorrow you'll defeat
[01:38.43]The picture you see
[01:39.58]It won't dissapear
[01:41.00]Not unpleasant mdream
[01:42.11]Or the voice you hear
[01:45.82]
[01:47.02]You know where you sent her
[01:49.31]You should know where you are
[01:51.93]You're trying to ease off
[01:54.30]But you know you won't get far
[01:57.06]And now she's up there
[01:59.51]Sings like an angel
[02:01.88]But you can't hear those words
[02:07.07]And now she'd up there
[02:09.65]Sings like an angel
[02:14.03]Unforgivable sinner
[02:20.91]
[02:35.59]Maybe one time lost
[02:38.02]But now you're found
[02:40.51]Stand right up before you hit the ground
[02:45.68]Maybe one time lost
[02:47.84]But now you're found
[02:50.53]Stand right up before you hit the ground,hit the ground
[03:00.24]
[03:02.07]You know where you sent her
[03:04.35]You should know where you are
[03:06.89]You're trying to ease off
[03:09.29]But you know you won't get far
[03:11.99]And now she's up there
[03:14.46]Sings like an angel
[03:16.85]But you can't hear those words
[03:21.82]And now she'd up there
[03:24.56]Sings like an angel
[03:28.94]Unforgivable sinner
