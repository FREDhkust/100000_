[00:17.58]Parsley,sage,rosemary and thyme 
[00:26.50]Remember me to one who lives there 
[00:33.63]She once was a true love of mine* 
[00:43.43]Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (Oh the side of a hill in the deep forest green) 
[00:51.00]Parsley,sage,rosemary and thyme (Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown) 
[00:59.84]Without no seams nor needle work (Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain) 
[01:07.56]Then she`ll be ture love of main (Sleeps unaware of the clarion call) 
[01:16.76]Tell her to find me an acre of land (On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves) 
[01:24.09]Parsley,sage,rosemary and thyme (Washes the grave with silvery tears) 
[01:32.91]Between the salt water and the sea strand (A soldier cleans and publishes a gun) 
[01:40.74]Then she`ll be a true love of mine 
[01:50.17]Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather (War bells blazing in scarlet battalion) 
[01:57.44]Parsley,sage,rosemary and thyme (Generals order their soldiers to kill) 
[02:06.22]And gather it all in a bunch of heather (And to fight for a cause they`ve long ago forgotten) 
[02:14.85]Then she`ll be a true love of mine
