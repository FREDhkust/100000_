[00:27.40]There comes a time when we heed a certain call
[00:33.47]When the world must come together as one 
[00:39.62]There are people dying
[00:42.66]And it's time to lend a hand to life
[00:48.39]The greatest gift of all
[00:53.49]We can't go on pretending day by day 
[00:59.71]That someone, 
[01:01.43]Somewhere will soon make a change
[01:06.68]We are all a part of god's great big family 
[01:13.06]And the truth, you know, love is all we need
[06:38.15][06:11.79][05:45.72][05:19.31][04:53.24][04:26.77][04:00.48][03:34.15][03:07.94][02:15.06][01:19.21]We are the world, we are the children
[06:44.68][06:17.20][05:52.18][05:22.33][04:59.56][04:33.52][04:07.13][03:40.70][03:14.41][02:21.47][01:25.62]We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving
[06:25.39][05:59.15][05:33.02][05:06.16][04:41.23][04:10.10][03:47.45][03:21.26][02:28.12][01:32.51]There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives
[06:31.90][06:05.91][05:39.29][05:13.04][04:47.11][04:20.85][03:54.33][03:28.15][02:35.53][01:39.42]It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me
[06:54.79][06:37.43][06:11.55][05:45.54][05:17.92][04:51.47][04:25.73][03:58.92][03:33.00][02:39.88][01:44.51]
[01:48.53]Oh Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares 
[01:56.03]And their lives will be stronger and free
[02:02.37]As god has shown us by turning stones to bread 
[02:08.93]So we all must lend a helping hand
[02:14.44]
[02:42.01]When you're down and out,there seems no hope at all
[02:48.62]But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
[02:53.55]Let us realize that a change can only come 
[03:01.67]When we stand together as one
[03:06.66]
